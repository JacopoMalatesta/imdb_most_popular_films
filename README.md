# Building a cloud database of the 5000 most rated films on IMDB 
The goal of this project is to create a database of the 5000 most rated feature films on IMDB. 

The project will comprise the following steps:

- collecting the data through scraping and API requests;
- cleaning the data and doing some EDA;
- loading the data to both a MYSQL and a PostgreSQL database on Amazon RDS;
- querying the database with SQL;
- visualizing the output of the queries with R.

My hope is that this project may succeed in showcasing my skills in API requests, scraping, regex, EDA, data cleaning, databases and data visualization, as well as with multiple programming languages (Python, R and SQL).
