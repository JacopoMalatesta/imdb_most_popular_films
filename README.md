# Building a database of the 5000 most popular films on IMDB 
The goal of this project is to build a database of the 5000 most popular feature films on IMDB. 

In this project "popularity" is defined as the number of ratings a film has received. 

The project will comprise the following steps:

- collecting the data through scraping and API requests;
- cleaning the data and doing some EDA;
- loading the data onto a PostgreSQL database;
- querying the database with SQL;
- visualizing the output of the queries.

My hope is that this project may succeed in showcasing my skills in API requests, scraping, regex, EDA, data cleaning, databases and data visualization.
